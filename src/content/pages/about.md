title: About 3 Day Healing
---
3 Day Healing started in the middle of the pandemic as a small group of healers based in Austin Texas realized there was no better time to accelerate people's spiritual processes than in the middle of a world wide crisis.  

In order to do so we wanted to create a concise program that included a variety of healing practices over a short period of time at an affordable price. While most healing and wellness retreats can take you back 3,000 to 6,000 dollars we wanted to create a trully transformative experience without breaking the bank. 

In order to do so we created an event format that allowed us to reduce costs significantly while providing an incredible experience for all our attendees. 

Additionally we began recruiting other certified healing professionals and facilitators to help us expand the program beyond Austin. 

We are now 20 facilitators strong working on more than 15 cities in the united states providing incredible experiences that help participants let go of their densities and embrace their true potential.
