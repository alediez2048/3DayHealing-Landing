title: About 3 Day Healing
---
3 Day Healing started in the middle of the pandemic as a small group of healers based in Austin Texas realized there was no better time to accelerate people's spiritual processes than in the middle of a world wide crisis.  

In order to do so we created a concise program that includes a variety of healing practices over a short period of time at an affordable price. While most healing and wellness retreats tend to focus on a single practice and can take you back 3,000 to 6,000 dollars, we wanted to create a trully transformative experience without breaking the bank. 

Additionally we began recruiting other certified healing professionals and facilitators to help us expand the program beyond Austin. 

We are now 20 facilitators strong working on more than 15 cities in the united states providing incredible experiences that help participants let go of their densities and embrace their true potential.
