Each retreat is a **deeply transformative journey**, which incorporates a blend of **traditional and non-traditional healing modalities** all designed to return you back home to your true Self.

Most retreats are designed to have you relax, learn a few things and you come back feeling good for a time, but it never seems to stick. 3 Day healing is created and facilitated to give you the **unique emotional intelligence tools** to help you function at your **Highest Self**. In this retreat, We have created unique transformational processes that are far beyond note taking, information gathering, and theory.
