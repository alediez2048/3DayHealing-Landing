The invitation I am about to share with you is not for everyone.


But if it is for you. You will know without a shadow of a doubt.

There will be an undeniable calling in your heart. You will be deeply moved. Your soul will light up. And every cell in your body will resonate.

Trust it.

Similarly, many years ago, guided by destiny, I found myself on a soul searching quest, and ultimately a profoundly life altering journey. 

I believe there are no coincidences, and the fact that you are reading these words you have been led here by a stirring in your soul. Every moment of your life is an opportunity to choose to live more fully or to hold back. What could you do? Who could you be if you really faced the fears that keep you complacent? 

I believe that one of the greatest pains in life is to live a meaningless life. To walk around each day feeling that so much of your potential isn’t fully expressed, and that you are not living your true life’s purpose and destiny. You can have “everything,” but if you don’t know who you truly are, you have nothing.

Reflect for a moment…

Do you feel overwhelmed by all the responsibilities of life and end up neglecting your deepest personal needs and desires?

Do you feel deep within your heart, the sense that there is a bigger reason you are here on this planet, and that there is a meaningful contribution for you to make?

Nothing will be different unless you do things differently. 

Are you ready to listen to the calling of your own heart?

Are you ready to live your soul’s Destiny?

Are you ready to live a life that is a bold adventure?

This personalized individual retreat is completely geared toward your potential and unique path of spiritual self-realization. It is a retreat for…

Real Life Breakthrough
My work is about connecting you back to your true source, your ‘essence’. It isn’t simply about getting more money or things in your life, its about discovering YOU are the one you have been waiting for! You have within you everything you have been seeking. I teach you how to connect with the source of creativity, abundance, freedom, joy, peace and love right within yourself!

You will return home not only rejuvenated and inspired by your own creative path in life, but with the tools needed to transform every day life circumstances into your life's masterpiece. 

This retreat is unlike any other …
It is like combining the best of a meditation retreat, deep intensive therapy, sacred psychology, personal medicine walks in nature… only instead of being plopped in a group auditorium – OR into the wilderness with only a tent and bottle of water, this process is nurtured in a much (MUCH) more civilized, comfy, and supported environment that effects the same powerful life breakthrough!

What you will find here – IS YOU! The Real YOU!

Types of clients range from those with no to those with extensive experience with inner spiritual selfhood, and from all spiritual paths including psychologists, healers, artists, homemakers, business men simply those who feel bereft, lost to themselves, overtaken by the mind-noise of daily living…

A very important self-awakening soul-stirring process has already begun
That is what has lead you to this website at this moment in time. You are in the process of honoring the voice of your soul, the voice that so often gets overrun by the fears of the mind. 

Imagine living your purpose, giving your gifts to the world and leaving a lasting legacy.

Imagine living life in the flow, where your goals, desires, intentions, manifest with grace and ease.

Imagine living a life of true freedom, where you can stand unshakable amidst the chaos of everyday experiences.

Imagine living a life where inspiration flows through you and you create abundance effortlessly.

There comes a point in your life, when who you are seeking to become is bigger than who you currently are. You hear a calling from deep within. A call to greatness, a call to a new life. It is a call to let go of the known and jump into a new realm of what is possible for your life—a life without limits. 

I invite you to join me on this once-in-a-lifetime paradigm altering journey. The journey will call you from deep within your own heart. All that will be left for you to do is answer the call.

So...

Will you answer the call?
