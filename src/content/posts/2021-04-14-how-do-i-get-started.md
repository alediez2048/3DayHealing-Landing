Awareness is the first step in healing. You can sign up for a 3 Day Healing Program but no amount of healing retreats will help you overcome your limitations if you yourself are not ready. It's only when we become more aware of how powerfully our beliefs, thoughts, choices in diet, and lifestyle affect us—for better and for worse—then we can make better choices. However, if we don't love ourselves we won't make those simple choices. This is why LOVE is the greatest model for optimal health.

When you make healthy choices, you feel better quickly. This allows us to connect the dots between what we do and how we feel.  Feeling so much better, so quickly, re-frames the reason for changing from fear of dying to joy of living. Joy and love are powerful, sustainable motivators, but fear and deprivation are not. 

People often think that advances in medicine have to be a new drug, a new laser, or a surgical intervention to be powerful—something really high-tech and expensive. They often have a hard time believing that the simple choices that we make in our lives each day—what we eat, how we respond to stress, whether or not we smoke, how much we exercise, and the quality of our relationships—make such a powerful difference in our health, our well-being.

Part of the value of science is to raise our awareness by helping us to understand the powerful effects of our beliefs, thoughts, and lifestyle choices we make each day—and how changing these may significantly, sometimes dramatically, improve our health and well-being. In many cases, these improvements may occur much more quickly than people had once believed possible.
